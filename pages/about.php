<div class="about">
    <p>Hi, my name is Rodrigo Destri Perozin, I'm 20 years old, I'm a student and professional in the field of
        Systems Analysis and Development (ADS). If I were to classify myself in a professional level, I would say 
        that I am a Junior/Mid-level, even because I have been studying and interested in the area since 2014. 
        My training currently is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Systems Analysis and Development Technician</i></li>
        <li><i>Bachelor in Systems Analysis and Development</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was always curious to know how systems and websites work, how they were created, I had no idea,
        until one day I started looking for tutorials on how to create systems, websites, and from then on I always kept
        contact with the area. At the end of high school, I completed a technical degree (mentioned above), and I was able to have contact with several
        technologies and concepts in the programming area. Now, I'm graduating with a Bachelor's in Analytics and Development
        of Systems, and in addition, I already had experience in the job market, and I haven't stopped since then, below are my
        experiences in the job market:

    <p>Throughout my professional experience, I learned how to maintain
        in codes, create new functions and screens in a system, analyze
        of a system, have strong communication with the team for good
        project progress, I learned a lot about analyzing business rules
        and how important they are for the work process based on demands.
        Makes great use of methodologies to evolve and organize work,
        making them faster and more complete, such as the methodology
        <b>Kanban</b>, which works as the image below illustrates:

        <p>Kanban is a visual process management methodology that is based
            on visual cards to represent tasks on a board. Each card represents
            an activity and cycles through columns indicating its status in the workflow,
            usually divided into stages such as "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done".
            The system aims to optimize efficiency by limiting work in progress to avoid
            overload and identify bottlenecks. The approach allows for a flexible response to changes
            priorities, improving transparency and communication within the team. Kanban is
            especially effective in agile development contexts, where visibility and control
            of workflow are crucial to the continuous delivery of value.</p>

        <p>I also worked with the Scrum methodology of work divided into <b>sprints</b>, which works
            as follows: Work divided into sprints is a fundamental concept in the agile framework
            Scrum. A sprint is a fixed period of time, usually two to four weeks, during which
            a team commits to delivering working product increments. At the start of each sprint, there are
            defined goals and priority items for the product backlog. The team then plans how to achieve
            these goals during the sprint. During the sprint, daily synchronization meetings called
            Daily Scrum. At the end of the sprint, there is a review, where the completed work is demonstrated
            and feedback is received.</p>

    <p>Now that you've read a little about my experiences, how about finding out about my intentions for the future?
        Well, in a few years I see myself producing solutions and solving problems for the world, making life easier
        of people, and impacting everyone's daily lives with my innovations. I want to venture out, discover,
        challenge myself in my own business, who knows? Maybe, everything will depend on my actions and my willingness to do
        things happen. We are all constantly learning, even when we make mistakes, we are learning something, therefore,
        I will try to use each discovery, error or success, to strengthen myself and be a more complete professional!
